# mcp23017-demo
Demonstration programs for controlling MCP23017 I/O expanders

These programs will help you understand how to control MCP23017 expanders
(most notably, setting them up as outputs).

You must have the libi2c-dev installed.

It's best to compile and run this on a Raspberry Pi mod B revision 2, or newer.
A+, B+ and RPi 2 will work too.
Any Linux distribution should work, although Raspbian wheezy is the most popular
and you want to stick with this.
